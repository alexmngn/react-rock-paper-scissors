Acceptance Criteria

- Ability to play against the computer
- Ability to simulate a game (Computer vs Computer)
- Ability to restart the game
- Computer generated plays need to be random

Guidelines

- The UI can be as simple or as complex as you wish

- We are keen to see how much you think is enough, and how much would go into a Minimum Viable Product.  As a guide, elegant and simple wins over feature rich every time, though extra gold stars are given to people who get excited and do more because they are having fun.

- We also consider the extensibility of the code produced.  Well factored code should be relatively easily extended. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock may be a natural extension. 

- Bonus points for good accessibility, JavaScript unit tests, Responsive and well commented code




Technical Requirements

- jQuery or equivalent library’s are allowed (no plugins) but it is important for us to see that you can write pure JavaScript. We want to see your code, not someone elses.
- Sass / Less are allowed
- The solution should work in IE9+ and all modern browsers, bonus points ie8 and lower
