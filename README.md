The architecture is feature-based and follows the recommendation from the article I wrote on Medium: [How to better organize your React applications?](https://medium.com/@alexmngn/how-to-better-organize-your-react-applications-2fd3ea1920f1)

It can easily be extended to different versions of the game, such as "Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock"

The project has unit tests which only covers the main game features.

You can fork and clone the project and run `npm install` to install the external dependencies.
This project has been tested with node v7.7.1 and npm 4.1.2.
